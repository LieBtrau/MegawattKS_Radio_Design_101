    "# Detector versus Discriminator\n",
    "A **detector** is a circuit that extracts the modulating signal from the modulated carrier.  A **discriminator** is a specific type of detector that converts frequency variations of the modulated signal into amplitude variations, which can then be demodulated to recover the original audio signal.\n",

    "## Design\n",
    "Some of the resources use a single JFET mixer, but that has strong dependence on device to device variations, and it leaks the LO signal into the output quite strongly.  A better solution is to use a double balanced mixer, which has a much lower LO leakage and is less sensitive to device variations, as done by W2AEW in his video.  Moreover, we're already using a double balanced mixer in the front-end, so we can use the same type of mixer for the pulse counting discriminator.\n",

It has a built-in IF amplifier that yields 12dB SINAD at -87dBm input signal level, so it can be used as a complete IF stage and we don't need a separate IF amplifier. \n",

    "In FM broadcast, it has been internationally agreed to restrict maximum deviation to **∆𝑓= 75 𝑘𝐻𝑧** on each side of carrier frequency (𝑓𝑐).\n",
