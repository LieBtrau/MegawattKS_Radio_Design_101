    "While R8 is not yet populated, we can use an easy test setup to verify the buffer amplifier performance.  We use REW (Room EQ Wizard) to generate a sine wave at 1kHz, which is fed into the audio input J7.  The output is measured at J5.3 using the oscilloscope.  A 100nF capacitor is soldered from audio input to ground near J7 to provide HF noise filtering.\n",

    "\n",
    "It comes down to a few picofarads, so we better keep a trimmer in place.  We could use a 20pF trimmer for C5 and leave C7 out.  As such, we allow for some tolerance on the value of L1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find solution for loud audio output at maximum volume <a id=\"potmeter-fix\"></a>\n",
    "Only a small portion of the usable range of the volume potentiometer can be used because at maximum volume the output is way too loud for a headset.  If you accidentally (or someone else on purpose) turn the volume knob to maximum, you may damage your hearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "1. It's undesirable to have a high impedance in the \"AUDIO\" net feeding into the next stage.  \n",
    "2. It's undesirable to add impedance in the ground lead because of noise pick-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed solution\n",
    "So let's try this:\n",
    "1. We could replace R18 and R19 by a single resistor of 100Ω.  That is still much lower than the 2.4kΩ input impedance of the next stage.\n",
    "2. Tie pin 2 & 3 of J5 together to have audio on both ears.  \n",
    "3. Add a 18Ω resistor from J5.5 to J5.2 and J5.3 to limit the output voltage.  Pin 5 of J5 will only be connected to ground (J5.1) when a jack is inserted.  Without the jack, it's out of the circuit and doesn't load down the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum volume with a 36Ω headset will then be limited to about 10mVrms, which is still very loud, but acceptable for short listening tests."
