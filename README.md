### FM Receiver
My inspiration for this project comes from the outstanding [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_p7AHsSOdw&list=PL9Ox3wpnB0kqekAyz6blg4YdvoEMoJNJY), "Radio Design 101". 

The author of the series also has a [companion website](https://ecefiles.org/rf-design/) where you can find class notes, lab assignments, etc. 

The first step in getting started was ordering some of these excellent [RF prototyping boards](https://github.com/maelh/radio-frequency-prototype-boards/tree/main) and moving away from solderless breadboards. 

I'm going to somewhat organize this page by the "project" number listed on the companion website. 

# Project 1: Tuned RF Amplifier

This is my initial design of a Common Base RF amplifier with DC operating point:
