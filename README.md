# Overview
This FM broadcast receiver is based on the ["Radio Design 101" YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_p7AHsSOdw&list=PL9Ox3wpnB0kqekAyz6blg4YdvoEMoJNJY).

The author of the series also has a [companion website](https://ecefiles.org/rf-design/) where you can find class notes, lab assignments, etc.
