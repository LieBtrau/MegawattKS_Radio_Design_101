    "Simulation shows that the equivalent capacitance of the varactor diode should be 9pF to 25pF to cover the 88MHz to 108MHz band, when using L=390nH and C5=100pF.  So that's a range of 16pF.  As we will be using two diodes in anti-series, each diode must cover a capacitance range of 18pF to 50pF.  We want to keep the voltage across each diode as high as possible to avoid driving them into forward conduction.  So we will use a tuning range of 8pF (5V) to 40pF (1.5V).  That means we will need about 5pF of fixed capacitance in parallel with the diodes to reach the required capacitance range.\n",

    "For the oscillation amplitude, we have two contradicting requirements.  On the one hand, we want a high amplitude to drive the mixer stage properly.  On the other hand, we want a low amplitude to avoid driving the varactor diodes into forward conduction.  We will aim for an oscillation amplitude of about 1V peak-to-peak, which should be a good compromise."

    "At these high frequencies, each buffer amplifier stage has a current gain of only 6.  So the resistance seen looking into the base is only 6 times the resistance seen looking into the emitter.  Therefore, we need at least two buffer stages to isolate the oscillator from the mixer stage.\n",

    "2. Replace biasing resistors by thevenin equivalent and replace emitter resistor by a current source.\n",
    "3. Set signal source to 700mV amplitude.  With a 1x voltage gain, it will result in 7dBm into 50 ohms, which is 15mArms\n",
    "4. Tune the current source to get lowest distortion at about 7dBm output power.  It will be in the order of 15mA collector current.\n",
    "5. Either replace the current source by an actual current source circuit, or replace it by an emitter resistor.\n",
    "6. Tune the thevenin equivalent resistance and voltage to get the lowest distortion at that output power.  Ideally, the thevenin equivalent resistance should be as high as possible to avoid loading the preceding stage.\n",
    "7. Then replace the thevenin equivalent by the preceding CC-amplifier stage.\n",
    "8. Again have the emitter resistor replaced by a current source, and tune the current source to get lowest distortion at that output power.\n",
    "9. Again replace the biasing resistors by thevenin equivalent.\n",
    "10. Finally, replace the thevenin equivalent by the resistors."
