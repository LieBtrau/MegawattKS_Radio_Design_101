    "The operation of a diode ring mixer is also explained in [Analog Devices : Activity: Diode Ring Modulator - ADALM2000](https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/electronics/electronics_lab_diode_ring_modulator).  Mind that in this explanation, the LO-port is the port that is connected to the diode ring.  This only works if the LO-signal is symmetrical around 0V, which is not the case for the SI5351.  \n",

    "### Diode selection\n",
    "  * 4 diodes in a SOT-363 package : for better matching\n",
    "  * avoiding schottky diodes because of their low forward voltage drop, which would result in a lower allowed signal level (BAS40, BAS70)\n",
    "  * BAV99 is quite fast, with a reverse recovery time of 4ns (Schottky BAS7004SH6 is apparently only 100ns).  \n",
    "  * 1N4148 has comparable speed, to the BAV99\n",
    "  * Fastest common diodes are the SD101 (1ns reverse recovery time).  These are single diodes (SOD123 or SOD323 package), so 4 of them are needed.\n",
