    "# Gain\n",
    "We need about 100dB of gain from the amplifier to the demodulator. The first stage is a low-noise amplifier (LNA) with a gain of 20dB, followed by a mixer with a gain of 3dB.  So we can suffice by cascading 2 amplifier stages with a gain of 40dB each. \n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "The noise source can couple back into the supply lines, which can cause unwanted oscillations in the circuit. To prevent this, a series resistance is added to the supply lines. This resistance dampens the series LC-circuit formed by the wire lead inductance and the local decoupling capacitor, reducing the high-frequency noise that can couple back into the circuit.\n",
    "This is a common practice in RF design to prevent unwanted oscillations and improve stability.  The image shows the effect of the series resistance on the supply voltage. \n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "Because the amplifier has so much gain, we have to avoid gain compression when measuring the frequency response.  Therefore a 50dB attenuator is placed on the input.  A 40dB attenuator would have been sufficient as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure a gain of approximately -12dB at 10.7MHz, which results in a total gain of approximately 38dB when taking the 50dB attenuator into account.  This is close to the simulated gain of 40dB.\n",
